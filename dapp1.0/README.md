This is a simplistic marketplace app that handles creating and transferring of listings.

To start:

1. cd dapp1.0 --> npm install --> npm start

2. Have Metamask installed and connect your Metamask wallet. (Without Metamask, you are unable to use the application.)

3. The listings there are already created by me before hand, with a hard-coded contract address.

Just some notes:

1. If the item is 'Sold' or you are the owner viewing your own listing in the 'Home' page, the button will be disabled for you.

2. Metamask wallet balance is difference from Account Balance. You can think of Account Balance as a top-up into the application.

3. All amounts to be input (Fund/Withdraw) only deals well with whole numbers.

4. To edit a listing, input the item ID, and then click "Search Listing" to display the item details. After changing them, then click on "Edit Listing" to edit the listing.

Might be a little too simple, and frontend is extremely sloppy...
